    <h2>Jacqueline Bento</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Jacqueline Bento, I have been married for 15 years and counting! I have two children aged 13 and 11. I am Brazilian but I have lived in the USA for 5 years while my husband completes his studies.
        Seeing my husband in college encouraged me to start my study journey too, I got an associate degree before getting married, but soon the children came and I dedicated myself to the family, now I intend to improve my studies to return to the job market.
        One of the things I like most about the BYU education system is that it can have gospel teaching integrated with secular teaching. I was very happy to see that this semester I will have the opportunity to study more about Christ.
